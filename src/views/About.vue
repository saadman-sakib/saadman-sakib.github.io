        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I am a junior year student of mechatronics engineering with a strong passion for applying technology to solve
            real-world problems. With skills in numerical analysis using Python, embedded system programming, machine
            learning, web programming, and app development, I am well-equipped to take on a variety of technical challenges.
            My interests include exploring the exciting field of reinforcement learning, delving into the intricacies of
            modern nonlinear control systems, and experimenting with transformer-based neural networks. I am also interested
            in the emerging field of quantum computing and its potential for revolutionizing computation. I am ready to work
            in collaborative environment with other enthusiast technologist, and learn new tools and techniques.</p>
