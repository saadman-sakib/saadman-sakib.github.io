        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering department at the University of
            Dhaka. My research interests lie in the intersection of biomedical engineering and wearable technology,
            focusing on medical imaging, wearable monitoring devices, and MMG signal sensing using piezo and
            accelerometer sensors. I am particularly interested in developing efficient sensor packaging techniques with
            rigorous testing to ensure reliability and accuracy. Additionally, I explore 3D visualization methods for
            better data representation and work on selecting comfortable, skin-friendly materials for long-term wearable
            applications. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of remote health monitoring systems, making them
            more accessible and effective</p>
